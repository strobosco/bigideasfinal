## The project

For the final project you will work as part of a team to answer the question:

<div align='center' style='font-size:20px;'><italic>What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh?</italic></div>
<br />

Using data from the [WPRDC](http://www.wprdc.org), you will create a data driven argument to support your claim about the “best” neighborhood in Pittsburgh.With your group members, you will be creating a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate your argument and the data analysis you did to support it. You will present your arguments to the class in the last two weeks of lab sections.

<br />

## Analysis

### Maximus

Maximus analyzed police arrest data and criminal activity in 96 Pittsburgh neighborhoods. He was able to 
obtain the amount of total and unique offenses in each neighborhood and created helpful visualizations for
the rest of the team.

### Niccolo

Niccolo analyzed data concerning 68 neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. He was able to indentify which neighbothoods
had the most playgrounds and which had the least, correlating each quantity with the happiness metric the team used.

### Emmett

Emmett analyzed data concerning the rent in 91 Pittsburgh neighbohoods. He was able to calculate the average
rent in each neighborhood and sort these into most and least expensive. He also created helpful visualizations
to see the cost of rent in Pittsburgh.
